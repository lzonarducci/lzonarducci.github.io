	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	<p>
		I love sports. I am not so good at playing them, though I do have some 
		experience. So I am mostly relegated to watching and enjoying them. 
		I follow four main leagues, major league baseball, football (the 
		American kind), DotA 2 (esports), and Overwatch (also esports), pretty 
		closely. I also loosely follow hockey and sometimes soccer. I am from 
		Philadelphia, so I in no way, shape, or form will claim that what I 
		write here is unbiased. However, I hope to be able to provide some 
		good insights. Philly Philly!
