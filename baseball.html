	<h1>Introduction and Vision</h1>
	<p>
		Welcome to a mini blog about America's favorite pasttime and my favorite 
		sport. I've just started this thing, so I have nothing yet, but I have big 
		dreams. I'm hoping to have a live standings and be able to post my thoughts
		 on the current status of the league. 
	</p>
	<p>
		I played little league, mostly right and centerfield, because I wasn't 
		very good. But I could bunt and walk and steal bases. Most importantly 
		it was fun. It was soon after I got too old for little league, which 
		I'm guessing was aorund 2011 because most of my memories of following 
		the Phillies have been when they were bad. So it's a little weird that 
		they are actually good this season.
