	<h1>The Overwatch League</h1>
	<p>
		The inaugural season of the Overwatch League is in the books, and it 
		appears to have been a huge success. Blizzard has done an excellent job 
		designing and marketing their new esport. Most other games are 
		organized by tournaments. Teams are either invited to tournaments or 
		qualify for them. They then play in some form of round robin followed 
		by a bracket to crown a champion who wins part of that tournament's 
		prize pool. The largest prize pool in esports is Dota 2's The 
		International 7 tournament, which had an impressive 
		<a href="http://dota2.prizetrac.kr/">$24,787,916</a>. TI8 is just a few 
		thousand short of the mark set last year.
	</p>
	<p>
		The Overwatch League, however, is set up like a more standard sports 
		leauge. The league is set up in seasons where each team will play every 
		other team. In fact, each team will play every other team once per 
		stage. This past season, a team would play twice a week and each stage 
		lasted five weeks. At the end of a stage, the top four teams of that 
		particular stage would face of in a mini tournament. Then, after all 
		four stages had concluded, the top six teams went on to the main 
		playoffs. Additionally, teams represent a city instead of a region. 
		In other esports, teams come from different regions, although what 
		nationalities actually play for that team are a bit of a gray spot.
	</p>
	<h1>The Philadelphia Fusion</h1>
	<p>
		I'll admit, I didn't watch too much of the first ever Overwatch League 
		season. But I did follow it to see how my team was doing. Being from 
		Philadelphia meant that there was one team I was going to root for: the 
		Philadelphia Fusion. At first, I was a bit skeptical if this team would 
		embrace the Philly sports culture. Esports is a lot different than 
		battle on the football field, but this team embraced the 100% effort 
		all the time that I have come to expect out of my Philly teams. They 
		embraced the underdog attitude when analysts wrote them off as a 
		middling team at best. They embraced the "no one likes us, we don't 
		care" attitude that we've always had, but only had in words since
		<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5eBYejv1g">Jason Kelce's 
		legendary speech</a>. And you know what? They did it.
	</p>
	<p>
		Going into the season, it looked like the Fusion would be riddled with 
		problems. They missed all of the preseason, one of their players was 
		suspended, and they consistently ran into communication breakdowns 
		from the many different nationalities that played on the team. But this 
		team did not let that get in their way. They liked to play aggresive 
		and push their opponents off balance. And, more often than not, they 
		came up clutch. The players themselves said that one of their biggest 
		strengths was coming up in clutch situations. In the end team qualified 
		for the stage two playoffs, upsetting the London Spitfire in the first 
		round and made it to the first ever Overwatch League playoffs.
	</p>
	<h1>Playoffs</h1>
	<p>
		It was not much surprise that the New York Excelsior made the top seed 
		in the playoffs. They had lost just six matches all of the regular 
		season (out of 40). Behind them were the Los Angeles Valiant, who 
		secured the first round bye with a resurgent second half, finishing 
		27-13 to take the Pacific Division. The Boston Uprising would take the 
		third spot at 26-14. The only other team to qualify from the Pacific 
		Division was the other L.A. team, the Gladiators. The London Spitfire, 
		despite an abysmal second half, managed to make it with a 24-16 record. 
		They would take on the Gladiators in the first round. Philadelphia also 
		qualified with a 24-16 record, but with a lower map win/loss 
		differential, would be slated to take on Boston.

	<h2>Round One</h2>
	<h3>London Spitfire at Los Angeles Gladiators</h3>
	<p>
		A lot of people, including myself had the Gladiators winning against 
		the Spitfire. After a dominant first two stages where London was 
		dominant. Many had them pegged at making a good run at becoming the 
		first ever Overwatch League champions. However, the second half changed 
		this perspective. The Spitfire looked bad and seemed to lose direction. 
		Meanwhile, the Gladiators were the hottest team coming into the 
		playoffs, finishing Stage 4 with the best record at 9-1.
	<p>
		The Gladiators started this one strong, handing the eventual champions 
		their only match loss in the playoffs. 
	</p>
	<h3>Philadelphia Fusion at Boston Uprisng</h3>
	<p>
		Coming into this matchup, a lot of people liked the underdog Fusion to 
		win this match. The Fusion had typically played very well and beat the 
		Uprising and the meta seemed to favor the Fusion. I was excited for 
		this match to see what this team could do in person. I wasn't sure what 
		it would be like going to see videogames played live, but the Blizzard 
		Arena was on fire cheering for both teams, though mostly for Philly, 
		when I went on Friday.

		Philadelphia took game 1 in dominant fasion.
